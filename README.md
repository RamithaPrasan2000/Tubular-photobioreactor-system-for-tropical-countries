# Tubular photobioreactor system for tropical countries


## Project description
This project focuses on the design and development of a tubular photobioreactor system for the optimized cultivation of Haematococcus pluvialis, a microalgae species known for its high astaxanthin content. The system is engineered to enhance microalgal biomass productivity through controlled environmental conditions that support efficient photosynthesis, COâ‚‚ absorption, and oxygen release.

Key components of the reactor include a transparent tubular structure for maximum light exposure, an aeration and agitation system for gas exchange and nutrient mixing, and a sensor-integrated control unit for real-time monitoring of pH, temperature, and other vital parameters. Through systematic design and testing, the project aims to achieve high biomass yield, energy efficiency, and scalability for industrial applications.

The outcomes of this research contribute to sustainable biotechnology by promoting microalgae-based bioproducts and carbon capture technologies. The project also lays the groundwork for further innovations in photobioreactor design and bioengineering processes.
